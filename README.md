# Utils

Utils is a collection of config files and scripts that I've written
and collected over the years.

> [!WARNING]
> Some of these files were **NOT** tested enough to my standards. I've noted the files you should be careful with in the files list below.

## Included files

### Config files

1. **.vimrc**: I did _not_ write this. I downloaded this years ago, and unfortunately, I've lost the name of the original author.
1. **.zshrc**: Customises the ZSH environment (prompt design, extensions, &c.) to my liking.
2. **Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1**: [_NOTE: `gcm` (`git commit -m`) requires `Remove-Alias`, which PowerShell 6.0+._] Customises PowerShell in my Windows systems.

### Scripts

1. **compi**: Automatically compresses image into different levels. Featured in [Automated Image Compression for Web Development with Python](https://gist.github.com/noahdominic/3c4853bc5b41ff3389b12717caed7f0e).
1. **compv**: Automatically compresses videos for low data transfers. See docs in file.
1. **journey**: Submodule to [Journey](https://github.com/noahdominic/journey), a BASH-enabled journal/diary system.
1. **erase-all-forge-keybindings.sh**â€ : Deletes all the keybinding for the Forge extension on GNOME. This one is niche, imo.
1. **extractall**â€ : Extract all compressed packages into their own directories. I've only used this for extracting arrays of IMG files (this is how a lot of retro software is packaged) on Linux.
1. **git-myinit**: Typical `git init` but it autoadds an ignore file.
1. **git-rebaseall**â€¡: Rebase multiple branches into the current branch.
1. **git-update**: Fetches and prints the status
1. **json2csv**: Automatically converts JSONs to CSVs, if compatible. Really unstable.
1. **mkfile**: `touch` with support for directories
1. **ts2mp4**: Converts all TSs in the current directory and converts them to MP4.
